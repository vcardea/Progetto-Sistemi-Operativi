# PandOSsh - Phase 1 (The Queues Manager)

This repository contains the implementation of **Phase 1** for the PandOSsh operating system on uRISCV. This phase implements the Process Control Block (PCB) queues and the Active Semaphore List (ASL).

## Project Structure

The project follows the strict directory structure required for the assignment:

* `root/`
    * `CMakeLists.txt`: Build configuration.
    * `klog.c`: Kernel logging utility.
    * `headers/`: Global headers (`const.h`, `types.h`, `listx.h`).
    * `phase1/`:
        * `pcb.c`: Implementation of PCB queues and process trees.
        * `asl.c`: Implementation of the Active Semaphore List.
        * `p1test.c`: Test suite (Level 2).
        * `headers/`: Phase-specific headers (`pcb.h`, `asl.h`).

## Prerequisites

To build and run this project, ensure you have:
1.  **uRISCV emulator** installed.
2.  **GCC Toolchain for RISC-V** (`riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc`).
3.  **CMake** (Version 3.25+).

## Building

1.  Create a build directory:
    ```bash
    mkdir build && cd build
    ```

2.  Configure the project with CMake:
    ```bash
    cmake ..
    ```

3.  Compile:
    ```bash
    cmake --build .
    ```

This will generate `MultiPandOS.core.uriscv` and `MultiPandOS.stab.uriscv`.

## Running the Test

1.  Load the generated `.core.uriscv` file into the uRISCV emulator.
2.  Start the simulation.
3.  Observe the output in **Terminal 0**.
4.  Success condition: The system should print `So Long and Thanks for All the Fish` and then halt.
